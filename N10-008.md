**OSI Layers - MTHTECHED INC Example**\
__Physical Layer/Layer 1__\
__Page 6__\
What is the primary focus of the Physical Layer?\
What is an examples of a cable used in Networking?\
	- Figure 1-5 - UTP Cabling\
 __Page 7__\
What are other examples of hardware that belongs to the physcial layer?\
	- Figure 1-6 - Network Switch\
 	- Figure 1-7 - Network with physcal layer installed\

  What layer is the NIC apart of?\
  How do networks indetify computers on a network?\
  What does MAC stand for and where is it located?\
  What numerical system does the MAC address use?\
  How many bits are each character worth in a MAC address?\
  	- Figure 1-11 - Nic\

   __Page 10__\
